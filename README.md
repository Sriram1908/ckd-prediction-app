# 🩺 CKD Prediction Web App

A simple and user-friendly **Flask web application** that predicts **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** based on 24 medical input parameters provided by the user.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project leverages a trained **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model to assess the likelihood of CKD. Users enter medical data into a web form, and the app instantly predicts whether the person is likely to have CKD or not.
